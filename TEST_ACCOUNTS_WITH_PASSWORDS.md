# Test Accounts - Passwords

## ⚠️ Password Issue

The passwords for existing test accounts were set when you signed up, but I don't have access to them (passwords are securely hashed).

## ✅ Solution: Create New Test Account

### Option 1: Sign Up with Known Password (Recommended)

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click: **"Get Started"**
3. Use:
   - **Email:** `test@test.com` (or any email you want)
   - **Password:** `testpass123`
   - **Confirm Password:** `testpass123`
   - ✅ Check "I agree to Terms & Privacy Policy"
4. Click: **"Create Account"**

The account will be **auto-confirmed** and you can login immediately!

### Option 2: Reset Password for Existing Account

If you want to use an existing email (`testuser123@gmail.com`), you can:

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Click: **"Forgot Password?"** (if available)
3. Enter the email
4. Check your email for reset link

OR use the password reset API endpoint.

## 🎯 Recommended Test Account

**Email:** `test@test.com`

This is the simplest - just sign up fresh with a known password!
